# Information about supported ERA5-Land variables.
#
# - name: Name/identifier of the variable, used for requests.
# - short_name: Short name used in data files, used for processing.
# - unit: Scientific unit of the variable.
# - time: A list of hours (HH:MM) to fetch for daily aggregation.
#       - Accumulated variables (e.g., precipitation) are fetched at "00:00".
#       - Instantaneous variables are sampled at four hours.
# - accumulated: Whether the variable is accumulated (True) or instantaneous (False).
